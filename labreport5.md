# CSE15L lab report 5

## CSE 15L applying zsh commands

Since this is my first quater to use zsh commands in terminal, I found it was very interesting to take advantage of those commands. So in this last lab report, I would like to introduce a couple of interesting commands, though it cannot be useful(but it depends on how we use!!).

### banner command

This command will show the message you entered with a lots of "#"s! 

### playing tetris!

By entering the code above, you can download tetris and play it! The command line which says "bindkey" is making a new shortcut(in this case if you press control + T, then the tetris starts).

The tetris screen looks like this↑

### let the locomotive run!

Now, by downloading command package tool we can use terminal in more ways! In this case, I downloaded a command `sl` which is a very interesting command and it was developed becase lots of people mistype `sl` instead of `ls`. Here is how this weird `sl` command will run.

Wow, a locomotive appeared and ran. Sadly, this is a image so you won't be able to see how this locomotive runs, but if you try by yourself, you can see it!

## Finally

The class CSE15L was very beneficial for me. One of the most reason I thought this class was benefitial was that I was able to try out the code I learned in class through the lab, and if I had any questions, I could immediately ask the TAs for help. It is no exaggeration to say that this greatly improved my programming skills. The lab reports I have written over the past four times have also been a great opportunity for me to review what I learned in the lab. I am sure that what I have learned here will come in handy in my future CSE classes!
